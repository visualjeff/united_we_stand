UWS clan platform 
===================

Created for managing the UWS website and membership system and overall integration.  

###Our goals include:

1. A cloud based clan app (using ember.js) backed with a real cloud datasource from (firebase.com)

2. The app would be responsive in design (using Foundation 5) so we would automatically have both a mobile app and traditional web site from a single source base (on github).

3. We could use discourse for a discussion forum (even looks great on a mobile device) 

4. Integrate authentication with google, yahoo, twitter, opened.  Referred to in the industry as OAuth.

5. We would automate sign-up, management of roles, and have individual or group messaging.  

6. Maybe could even tie into the existing APIâ€™s exposed for different games (killzone, battlefield, call of duty, etc).  Providing tighter integration with official game sites.

7. Commerce piece - linking in Amazon (for game related purchases) so the site could generate a few dollars to offset any future costs.

8. Clothing piece - Offer clothes, caps, coffee cups and shot glasses with the logo.
